The Amazon coupon data contained drivers who were presented coupons to 5 different types of commercial establishments, in close to even proportions. Some accepted the coupons and some did not, and the investigation of the attributes that 
led to acceptance varied based on the type of coupon received "bar," "coffee," etc. Overall, the acceptance rate was 56.8%, but a careful investigation of "bar" coupons demonstrates that certain driver attributes were highly correlated 
with acceptance. In particular, the "bar" coupon acceptance rate, overall, was 41%, but the rates were much higher for drivers who went to the bar more than once a month.

There are a total of 257 + 253+ 156 = 666 people who went to a bar 3 times or less and accepted the coupon vs 397+570+830 = 1797 people who went to a bar 3 times or less in total. the acceptance rate in this population is 666 / 1797 = 37%

There are 117 people who went to a bar 4-8 times a month and accepted, and 36 who did so greater than 8 times a month and accepted. 
There were a total of 150 people who went to a bar 4-8 times a month and 49 people who went to a bar greater than 8 times a month. 
The acceptance rate for those who went to a bar more than 3 times a month, therefore, is (117+36)/(150 + 49) = 153 / 199 = 76.9%. 
Therefore, those who went to a bar more than 3 times seem to be accepting the bar coupon more. 

The population of drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 has an acceptance rate of the coupon of 68.18%. That is significantly higher to the overall acceptance rate of 41%. 

The acceptance rate of those who go to bars more than once a month, whose passenger is not a kid is 71.3%, much higher than the general population's acceptance rate and even higher than simply driver who go to the bar more than 1 time. 

Acceptance rate for those who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed, was 71.3%. 

Acceptance rate for those who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 was 72.2%. 

Acceptance rate for those who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and whose income is less than 50k is 45.8%. 

Clearly, going to bars a lot and not having family obligations is key!
